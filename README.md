## Project Background
#Team 4 Project Proposal MLB Stats
We would like to analyze different team statistics including:
1.	Team Hitting Stats (Batting Avg, RBI, etc.)
2.	Team Pitching Stats (Strikeouts, Saves, etc.)
3.	Team Fielding Stats (Errors, Double Plays, etc.)

**Supervised learning:**
Logistic regression, or Neural Networks
- Compare individual stats against a determined threshold of success (bucket the number of wins <70, 70-90, 90+).

**Unsupervised learning:**
PCA, t-SNE, K-means Cluster Analysis
-	Use a drop-down menu to choose a team. Then it tells you which teams are most like that team based on hitting/pitching/fielding stats. Also, overall which teams the chosen team is most like and had the most similar total stats.
- Using the grouping to analyze which stats have more influence on whether a team will be successful or not.
- [Tableau Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jason.mchone/viz/MLBTeamAnalysis_16790042773510/Story1)

**Questions we were trying to answer:**
- Can unsupervised learning classify teams using the data we have available?
- Could regression analysis be used to determine the anticipated number of wins in a season?
- What teams have performed best historically?

## Approach: 
We performed a **Stepwise Regression Analysis**, which is the iterative construction of a model where independent variables are removed in succession and testing for statistical significance after each iteration.

Our final model contained 10 independent variables (down from 24).
Furthermore, collinearity was evaluated and one additional variable was dropped.

**Model performance:**
- R2 Score: **0.9304714673783749**
- Training Score: **0.9303466731994289**
- Testing Score: **0.9297116942632093**
