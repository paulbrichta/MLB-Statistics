# MLB-Statistics

## Project Background
#Team 4 Project Proposal MLB Stats
We would like to analyze different team statistics including:
1.	Team Hitting Stats (Batting Avg, RBI, etc.)
2.	Team Pitching Stats (Strikeouts, Saves, etc.)
3.	Team Fielding Stats (Errors, Double Plays, etc.)

**Supervised learning:**
Logistic regression, or Neural Networks
•	Compare individual stats against a determined threshold of success (bucket the number of wins <70, 70-90, 90+).

**Unsupervised learning:**
PCA, t-SNE, K-means Cluster Analysis
•	Use a drop-down menu to choose a team. Then it tells you which teams are most like that team based on hitting/pitching/fielding stats. Also, overall which teams the chosen team is most like and had the most similar total stats.
•	Using the grouping to analyze which stats have more influence on whether a team will be successful or not.
•	[Tableau Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jason.mchone/viz/MLBTeamAnalysis_16790042773510/Story1)

**Questions we were trying to answer:**
•	Can unsupervised learning classify teams using the data we have available?
•	Could regression analysis be used to determine the anticipated number of wins in a season?
•	What teams have performed best historically?
